Video Editing with Johnny Harris: Develop an AI-powered video editing tool that can analyze Johnny Harris' Switzerland bunker footage and script to automate the process of finding relevant clips and creating montages based on the script.



​Innovating at the Intersection of Multimodal AI and M&E
​Twelve Labs and FBRC.AI are excited to bring together the best multimodal AI talent and the strongest AI community in Los Angeles for a groundbreaking 24hr hackathon focused on AI applications in media and entertainment.

​Multimodal AI is revolutionizing the media and entertainment industry, enabling new possibilities from script writing and location scouting in pre-production to object removal and scene stabilization in post-production. One of the most innovative and powerful ways that multimodal AI is transforming M&E is through video understanding - allowing computers to interpret video with the same nuanced context as humans by analyzing visual, audio, textual and other data types together.

​The Los Angeles AI community is uniquely positioned at the intersection of Silicon Valley tech innovation and Hollywood creativity. With a vibrant ecosystem of AI researchers, engineers, artists and entrepreneurs collaborating closely, LA is poised to drive the future of AI-powered media and entertainment.
​Hackathon Use Cases
​Participants will develop AI-powered solutions for challenges including:

​Video Editing with Johnny Harris: Develop an AI-powered video editing tool that can analyze Johnny Harris' Switzerland bunker footage and script to automate the process of finding relevant clips and creating montages based on the script.

​Highlight Reel Generation with Drew Binsky: Develop an AI-powered tool that can analyze Drew Binsky's travel footage and automatically generate engaging highlight reels that capture the best moments from his adventures around the world.

​Sports Press Conference Summarization and Highlight Generation: Develop an AI-powered tool that can automatically generate concise summaries and engaging highlight reels from sports press conference videos.
